                    <h3 class="text-center">What We Do</h3>
                    <p align="justify">We charge nothing to take up the work. You have only to take care of our incidental expenses like journeys (starting from metros / prime cities), boarding, and lodging and office expenses. As you are able to realize the deficiencies and losses with potential to increase power generation / reduce fuel consumption, the potential for profits would become apparent. Then we can share the profits; just pay us 5% of three years profits at current prices, taxes extra as applicable. This arrangement will ensure that you are always the gainer.
                        Other modalities can also be discussed e.g. lump sum charges.</p>
