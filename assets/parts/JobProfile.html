            <li><p class="text-left">Spent twenty one years in operating plant at <a href="http://www.hwb.gov.in/htmldocs/plants/Kota.asp">Heavy Water Plant, Kota</a>. Expert in GS process for heavy water production. Worked out and implemented highly successful solutions for GS process plants for:</p></li>
        <ul>
            <li type="circle"><p class="text-left">Eliminated the problem of formation of sulfur completely</strong></p></li>
            <li type="circle"><p class="text-left">Very efficient degassing of process feed water getting less than 7 ppb dissolved oxygen, without application of heat or catalysts</strong></p></li>
            <li type="circle"><p class="text-left">Optimization of cold and hot tower temperatures for energy and cost savings</strong></p></li>
            <li type="circle"><p class="text-left">Very effective monitoring and control of deuterium losses. So much so that our plants give 18.6% recovery from natural water on full year drummed heavy water basis.</strong></p></li>
            <li type="circle"><p class="text-left">Very efficient feed water treatment such that no antifoam is ever needed even with actual throughputs being 20% higher than original design and very little purging is called for.</strong></p></li>
            <li type="circle"><p class="text-left">Established surfactant based suitable antifoam which works adequately at very low dose of 0.2 ppm.</p></li>
            <li type="circle"><p class="text-left">Established safe operating practices such that loss of metal due to corrosion is less than 2 mm in three decades, no sudden ruptures and failures occurred ever.</p></li>
       </ul>
            <li><p class="text-left">Can design new Heavy Water Plant based on GS process to produce heavy water with less than 20 GJ/kg (best of the plants worldwide consume around 30 GJ/kg)</strong></p></li>
            <li><p class="text-left">Worked out incorporation of Cold & Hot strippers in GS process flow sheet to get 26% recovery from natural feed water. It can increase heavy water production by 30% at no extra cost.</strong></p></li>
            <li><p class="text-left">Carried out complete process design of new technology of Front End for Baroda plant for NH3-H2O exchange.</strong></p></li>
            <li><p class="text-left">Optimized steam and power cycles; gained around 7 MWe at Manuguru.</strong></p></li>
            <li><p class="text-left">Can help solve problems related to operation of <strong>Flares</strong></p></li>
